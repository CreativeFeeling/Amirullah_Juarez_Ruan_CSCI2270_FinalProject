    In this final project, the three of us will develop a program that allows user to find the restaurants between the five cities in
Colorado: Fort Collins, Boulder, Denver, Aurora, Colorado Springs. In addition, if the user cannot find any restaurant in the current city, then our program will show the user the shortest distance to other restaurant in other city. Other than that, our program will allow user to find any restaurants in those five cities based on name, price, and location. We are also going to provide the main menu where the user can see all the list of all restaurants in the five cities contain with all information about their location(city), rating, type of food(American, Mexican, Indian, Asian) and price. In order to develop this program, we will combine the concept of Binary Search Trees and Graph. We will create two different text files, one contains the information about the distance between cities and the other contains the information about all the restaurants, then the program will read those two text files. After reading the datas, then we allow the user to operate our program from the main menu.
