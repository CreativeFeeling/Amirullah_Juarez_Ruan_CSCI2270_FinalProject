# Amirullah_Juarez_Ruan_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary:
  In this final project, the three of us: Aufa Amirullah, Gregory Juarez, and Ningtian Ruan will develop a program that allows user to find the restaurants in Colorado(only in Fort Collins, Boulder, Denver, Aurora, and Colorado Springs). If the user cannot find any restaurant in the current city, then our program will show the user the shortest distance to other restaurant in other city. Other than that, our program will allow user to find any restaurants in those five cities based on name, price, and location. We are also going to provide the main menu where the user can see all the list of all restaurants in the five cities contain with all information about their location(city), rating, type of food(American, Mexican, Indian, Asian) and price, as well as  adding and deleting restaurant. In order to develop this program, we will combine the concept of Binary Search Trees and Graph. We will create two different text files, one contains the information about the distance between cities and the other contains the information about all the restaurants, then the program will read those two text files. After reading the text files, then we allow the user to operate our program from the main menu. 

How to Run:
 For our final project, it has 8 options for helping users to search or add restaurants information. For example, Users can enter "1" to use "print vertices" find vertices between different cities of the restuarants. They also can use "Find restaurant","Search by kind of food","Search by price", "List restaurant in city", "Add restuarant" and "Delete restuarant" these options to search and adjust the information of the restuarants which already added in the project."Find shortest distance" is a option for users to find shortest way between different cities of the restuarants.

Dependencies:
 We used the inforamtion from the Google maps and created two files named "Cities.txt" and "restuarantData2.txt" in this project.These files are in the project folder.
